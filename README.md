This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Project Title: MakeMyThali - Online Thali Ordering Platform
1. Introduction
MakeMyThali is an online platform aimed at providing users with the convenience of ordering thalis, a traditional Indian meal served on a platter, with a variety of dishes. This project is being developed to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for customising their thali orders and placing them online.
2. Objective
The main objective of MakeMyThali is to create a user-friendly platform that allows users to:
    • Select from a list of dishes to customise their thali.
    • View the selected dishes in their thali and adjust quantities.
    • Place an order for the customised thali.
3. Features
3.1 Thali Customization
    • Users can browse a list of available dishes and add them to their thali.
    • Each dish will have options for selecting quantity and any additional preferences (e.g., spice level).
3.2 Order Placement
    • Users can review their customised thali before placing the order.
    • The platform will provide a secure checkout process for payment.
3.3 User Accounts
    • Users can create accounts to save their preferences and order history.
    • Registered users can view past orders and easily reorder their favourite thalis.

3.4 Admin Panel
    • An admin panel will be available for managing dishes, orders, and user accounts.
    • Admins can add new dishes, update existing ones, and view order details.
4. Architecture
The application will follow a client-server architecture.
4.1 Client-Side
    • The client-side will be developed using React.js for dynamic UI components.
    • It will handle user interactions and interface design.
4.2 Server-Side
    • The server-side will be developed using Node.js with Express.js framework.
    • It will handle authentication, data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
    • Data will be stored in a MongoDB database.
4.3 Communication
    • Client and server communication will be facilitated via RESTful APIs.
5. Technologies Used
    • Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS / Chakra UI
    • Backend: Node.js, Express.js
    • Database: MongoDB
    • Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
    • Payment Gateway Integration: RazorPay
    • Version Control: Git

Third-Party Services: 
    • Verification: Twilio (email & mobile no. verification)
    • Google Maps API for fetching location
    • Logistic Services Integration


6. Development Timeline
Phase 1: Setup and Basic UI
    • Set up the project environment.
    • Design and implement the basic user interface.

Phase 2: Backend Development
    • Implement server-side logic for dish management, user authentication, and order processing.
    • Set up a MongoDB database for storing dishes, users, and orders.
Phase 3: Frontend Development
    • Develop dynamic UI components using React.js.
    • Integrate frontend with backend APIs for thali customization and order placement.
Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
    • Test the application for functionality, usability, and security.
    • Deploy the application on a hosting platform.
7. Conclusion
MakeMyThali is a significant project aimed at providing users with a convenient way to order customised thalis online. By completing this project, I aim to gain valuable experience in full-stack development, including frontend design, backend logic, database management, and integration with third-party services.
